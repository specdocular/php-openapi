/**
 * Marks objects whose fields should be merged into their parent's array representation.

 * In OpenAPI, some objects have fields that appear at the same level as their
 * parent's fields rather than being nested. For example:
 *
 * - PathItem: HTTP method operations (get, post, put) appear as direct keys
 * - Parameter: SerializationRule fields (schema, style) appear alongside name, in
 *
 * Objects implementing this interface signal that their serialized fields
 * should be spread into the parent object using the spread operator.
